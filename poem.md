# How do I poem?

1. Denial and isolation

  _A poem? My heart skips a beat._

  **Of course I can write a poem.**

  _How do I write a poem?_

  **Who can't write a poem?**

  _I just can't find the words this morning. Yes. That's it. The words are gone._

  ***I'll just need time.***

2. Anger

  Blink. The text cursor is blinking in and out on a blank page. Blink. *Its taunting me.*

  Blink. Why couldn't we learn this in school? Blink. *I didn't learn anything useful in school.*

  Blink. I need to start typing so I don't get distracted. Blink. *I'll get distracted no matter what.*

  Blink. ***The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.***

3. Bargaining

  I know its the computer's fault. That hater. Pencil and paper would be much better for this sort of work.

  Googling for the answer might help.

  I walk to the couch and lie down on it.

  Yes. This will help. Where I was sitting was the only thing that was wrong. Wrong with me.

  Now I can write a poem.

4. Depression

  I can't write a poem. The words are gone. They never existed.

  I lack more than words. I don't know what to write. I don't think what to write. Did I ever think?

  I think, therefor I am. Am I?

5. Acceptance

  **I don't know how to write a poem.**

  _Maybe I'll write about that._
